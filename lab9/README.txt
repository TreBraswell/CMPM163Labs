explanation:
I chose an image of downtown los angeles. It an interesting part of L.A. that has high rises in an area that mostly has residential. Its the only part of L.A. that has high rises in general. Therefore I tried to replicate this city by having  a small island of high rises amonst a bunch of small buildings. I did this by editing the for loop and adjusting the specified hieghts.
