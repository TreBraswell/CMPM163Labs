What is the formula given a u value of the uv coordinate (a value between 0 and 1), I get the x value of the pixel to sample from in this 8x8 texture?
What is the formula given a v value of the uv coordinate (a value between 0 and 1), I get the y value of the pixel to sample from in this 8x8 texture?
What color is sampled from the texture at the uv coordinate (0.375, 0.25)? (sample from the image based on the number your formula gives you i.e. (1, 0) is blue)

cubes left to right
1.The extra cube from part 1 of the tutorial using the concepst i just emulated them to make another cube
2.Made from the first part of the tutorial
3.Made from the first part of the tutorial
4.Created from the instructions from part 2
5.While looking at the example and the sheet I messed around and found how to make the bottom left. Then I applied that same idea to the other three
