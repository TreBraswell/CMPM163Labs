What is the formula given a u value of the uv coordinate (a value between 0 and 1), I get the x value of the pixel to sample from in this 8x8 texture?
What is the formula given a v value of the uv coordinate (a value between 0 and 1), I get the y value of the pixel to sample from in this 8x8 texture?
What color is sampled from the texture at the uv coordinate (0.375, 0.25)? (sample from the image based on the number your formula gives you i.e. (1, 0) is blue)
